The method of choice for studying of Quark-Gluon Plasma, that was discussed in length in the previous chapter, are collisions of relativistic nuclei. These are achieved in laboratory on particle accelerators. The work in this thesis was performed at Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) that can collide several species of nuclei, as well as polarized protons, at various energies. 


Four experiments have operated at RHIC so far: Phobos, Brahms\footnote{Broad RAnge Hadron Magnetic Spectrometers}, PHENIX\footnote{Pioneering High Energy Nuclear Interaction eXperiment}, and finally, recording data at the time of writing this thesis: STAR. Phobos and Brahms were decommissioned after concluding their physics programs in 2005 and 2006, respectively, and PHENIX is currently undergoing a major overhaul upgrade to be transformed into a new experiment: the sPHENIX~\cite{sphenix}. This state-of-the-art experiment will be able to measure charged particles with high rate in the entire azimuth. It will feature a time-projection chamber with a continuous readout, as well electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters which will make it a perfect tool for measuring jets and heavy flavor.

RHIC~\cite{RHICproject, RHICdesign} is a circular accelerator located in the Brookhaven National Laboratory 
(BNL) in the USA\@. It is a versatile accelerator capable of
colliding several species of nuclei (Au+Au, d+Au, Au+$^3$He, Au+Cu, U+U,~\dots) at
center-of-mass energies per nucleon
ranging $\snn = (\text{7.7--200})\,\si{\giga\electronvolt}$ in a collider mode or down to
$\snn = 3.9\,\si{\giga\electronvolt}$
using a fixed target \cite{fixedTarget}\@. This versatility allows for studying various properties of the QGP since, by changing the collision system, we are able to vary the initial geometry and energy density, pressure, and electromagnetic-field profiles. Moreover, RHIC has a unique capability to collide polarized protons with
the center-of-mass energy up to $\sqrt{s} = \SI{500}{\giga\electronvolt}$~\cite{polarizedProtons}\@. The overview
of the RHIC runs between 2013 and 2019 is summarized in Table~\ref{runTableYears}\@. The energies per nucleon $E_1$ and $E_2$ were taken from~\cite{RHICrunsTable} and \snn\ was calculated as
\begin{equation}
 \snn = \sqrt{m_\mathrm{N1}^2c^4 + m_\mathrm{N2}^2c^4 + 2E_1E_2 + 2\sqrt{E_1^2-m_\mathrm{N1}^2c^4}\sqrt{E_2^2-m_\mathrm{N2}^2c^4}}
\end{equation}
where $m_\mathrm{N1}$ and $m_\mathrm{N2}$ are the masses of an average nucleon in the collided ion.


 

\subsection{RHIC Accelerator Complex}
Ions and protons are accelerated in several stages before colliding in one of the RHIC experiments at the desired energy. Ions are generated in the Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS\nomenclature{EBIS}{Electron Beam Ion Source}~\cite{EBIS}) which provides all stable ion beam source ranging from deuterons to uranium. A part of the EBIS is the Linac which can reach energies up to\footnote{200 GeV can be reached in the case of protons} 200$\,$GeV\@. The EBIS can switch different ion species in the order of seconds which was important for the 2018 isobar running with zirconium and xenon.

\caption[Diagram of the RHIC accelerator complex.]{\label{RHICcomplex}Diagram of the RHIC accelerator complex~\cite{RHICpages}.}
\end{figure}

The ions then enter the circular Booster Synchrotron which accelerates them enough to enter the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS~\cite{AGS}). This is an accelerator that fulfilled a rich physics program, including three Nobel-prize discoveries, before the RHIC facility was constructed. From AGS, the ions enter the AGS-to-RHIC (AtR\nomenclature{AtR}{AGS-to-RHIC transfer line}~\cite{AtR}) transfer line. Finally, the ions are injected into RHIC where they are accelerated to their final energies. 

Protons experience a similar journey to the ions. However, they are produced by ionizing hydrogen gas and then injecting them directly into the Linac, and then they continue to be accelerated in the same way as the ions. One of the unique capabilities of RHIC is the ability to produce polarized protons up to 500$\,$GeV, which is facilitated by the so-called Siberian-Snake magnets in the RHIC accelerator ring. In the end, they are collided in one of the six crossing points. Currently, the only experiment, measuring collisions is STAR, as PHENIX is undergoing an upgrade into a new experiment called sPHENIX\@.

\section{Solenoidal Tracker At RHIC (STAR)}

STAR is a multipurpose detector that is capable of measuring charged particles and 
% When RHIC started its operation in the year 2000, it was a dream come true for many people studying the QGP and spin of the proton. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/STAR}\\
\end{center}
\caption{[Overview of the STAR detector.]\label{STAR}Overview of the STAR detector.}
\end{figure}

The Solenoidal Tracker At RHIC (STAR) experiment~\cite{STARoverview} can be seen in Figure~\ref{STAR}. It is a multipurpose detector with full-azimuth
coverage dedicated to
studying ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions and polarized proton--proton collisions. Currently in 2016, STAR is the
only detector system running at RHIC\@.

The main barrel of STAR is enclosed in a water-cooled magnet with a magnetic field of \SI{0.5}{\tesla}. The magnet contains the
following detectors: Time -Projection Chambre (TPC\nomenclature{TPC}{Time-Projection Chamber} --- Section~\ref{TPCsection}), the GEM
Chambers to Monitor the TPC Tracking Calibrations (GMT\nomenclature{GMT}{GEM Chambers to Monitor the TPC Tracking Calibrations}), 
which is a set of 8 GEM detectors, used for the calibration of the TPC callibration, and Time-Of-Flight
(TOF\nomenclature{TOF}{Time-Of-Flight Detector}) Detector (Section~\ref{TOFsection}). In 2014, STAR received two major upgrades
concerning the heavy flavor measurements: The Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT --- section~\ref{HFTsection}), and the Muon Telescope Detector (MTD) which consists of fast Multi-wire Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPC) palced
outside the magnet. The main purpose of the MTD is to detect muons, which can easily traverse the volume of the magnet. The important
detectors for the open-charm hadrons reconstruction are listed here:

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Time-Projection Chamber (TPC)\label{TPCsection}} 
It is not an exaggeration to say that the Time-Projection Chamber~\cite{TpcNim} is the beating heart of STAR. It combines the role of the main tracking detector with the ionizing-energy-loss
(\dedx) information for particle identification (PID\nomenclature{PID}{Particle IDentification}). The TPC is able to provide excellent tracking of particles down to low \pt\ with the large multiplicities at top RHIC energies.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/TPC}\\
\end{center}
\caption[Overview of the STAR Time-Projection Chamber.]{\label{TPC}Overview of the STAR Time-Projection Chamber~\cite{TpcNim}.}
\end{figure}


 

When a charged particle traverses through the TPC, it ionizes the gas in the TPC volume. Then, the created negative 
charge (electrons) drifts to the anodes where it encounters \SI{20}{\micro\metre} wide wires which amplify the signal that is,
consequently, measured. The position in the transverse plane to the beam line (the xy-direction) is measured thanks to the
granularity of the TPC anodes and the position along the beam line (in the z-direction) is fixed by measuring the time taken by
he electrons to drift to the anodes. Hence, the spatial position of the track is fixed. The drift velocity of the electrons
in the P10 gas is calibrated every several hours via a laser calibration system~\cite{laser}. 


The layout of the TPC is shown in Figure~\ref{TPC}. It is barrel-shaped with the outer radius of \SI{2}{\metre}, inner radius of \SI{0.5}{\metre} and length of \SI{4.2}{\metre}
with the beam pipe going through the center. This barrel is filled with the P10 gas: a mixture of 90$\,\%$ argon and 10$\,\%$ methane. It covers the full azimuth \nomenclature{$\phi$}{Azimuthal angle (in a perpendicular plane to the beam pipe)}($0 < \phi < 2\pi$) and the outer edge covers the
pseudorapidity range of $|\eta| < 1$. 
In the center ($z = 0$)\nomenclature{$z$}{Horizontal axis in STAR along the beam pipe}, it is divided into two halves by the, so called, Central Membrane which is connected to an electric 
potential of $-\SI{28}{\kilo\volt}$\@.  The sides of the cylinder consist of the, so called, field cage that ensures that the electric field in the TPC stays uniform.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{img/TPC_side}\\
\end{center}
\caption[A side view of the TPC-outer-sector pad plane.]{\label{TPCside}A side view of the TPC-outer-sector pad plane. The bubble shows additional information on the wire planes of the anodes~\cite{TpcNim}.}
\end{figure}

The bases of the TPC cylinder are grounded and equipped with multi-wire proportional chambers
(MWPC\nomenclature{MWPC}{Multi-Wire Proportional Chamber}) as sensitive detectors. Each side consists of 12 sectors, numbered like on a clock and split into 
the inner and outer parts. A side (the \nomenclature{$x$}{Horizontal axis in STAR, perpendicular to the beam pipe}\nomenclature{$y$}{Vertical axis in STAR, also rapidity}$xy$-plane) view of the sectors is shown in Figure~\ref{TPCside}\@. Each MWPC consists of 3 planes of wires mounted over a plane of sensitive pads. Going from inside of the TPC volume out, the innermost plane of wires makes the, so called, gating grid. This part acts as a shutter that does not allow any electrons to enter the MWPC and it stops the ions from escaping the MWPC into the drift area where they would distort the electric field. It also lowers the amount of noise in the MWPC as ions are eaten out by the wires. The second row of wires is called the Shield Grid and it terminates the amplification region created by the outermost plane of wires: the Anode Grid. Here, the drifting electrons are multiplied in avalanches around the wires where the voltage differentials are high. These wires are set on potential of $\sim$1350$\,$V which sets the signal multiplication to $\sim$20$\times$\@: A value selected as a sweet spot between spatial resolution and the signal amplification. The signal is subsequently read out from the rectangular pads behind the anode wires. The pads are placed so that they always have an anode wire in the middle and their pitch is 6.7$\,$mm along the wires and 20$\,$mm --- same as the distance between the wires --- across. 

Until the run 2018, the inner part utilized 13 rows and outer part with 32 rows of pads, the inner sectors, however, underwent a substantial 
upgrade in the year 2019~\cite{iTPC}. This upgrade increased the number of sensitive pad rows in the inner sector to the same number as in the outer sectors. This greatly
increased the efficiency, resolution, and pseudorapidity coverage of the TPC which, in turn, enabled the fixed-event measurements at STAR with the endcap-Time-Of-Flight (eTOF) detector in 2019 and, in the future, it will be able to facilitate the measurement of electron+ion and electron+polarized-proton collisions after the upgrade to eRHIC\@.

\end{figure}

The TPC provides excellent momentum-measuring and PID capabilities in a high particle-multiplicity environment of the heavy-ion collisions.
A plot of particle-species separation can be found in Figure~\ref{TpcPid}.

\section{Time-Of-Flight Detector (TOF)\label{TOFsection}} 



The main purpose of the Time-Of-Flight (TOF) detector~\cite{TOFproposal} is to extend the PID capabilities of STAR into higher 
momenta via the measurements of the time of flight from its point of origin of the charged particles (or vertex) to the TOF 
detector, thus measuring its velocity. It was partially installed at STAR in 2009 and the remainder was added in 2010 
to make the TOF fully operational.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/TOF_MRPC}\\
\end{center}
\caption[Layout of the TOF MRPC\@.]{\label{TOF_mrpc}Layout of the TOF MRPC~\cite{TOFproposal}\@. The upper and lower images show views of the longer and shorted edge, respectively. The two views do not show the same scale.}
\end{figure}

The TOF consists of 120 trays of Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPC)\nomenclature{MRPC}{Multi-gap Resistive Plate
Chamber}~\cite{MRPC} that cover $|\eta| \lesssim 0.96$ and $0 < \phi < 2\pi$. The time of the original collision is measured 
by the Vertex Position Detector (VPD\nomenclature{VPD}{Vertex Position Detector} --- see section~\ref{VPD}). The leading edge of 
the signal is sampled with \SI{25}{\pico\second} binning. Corrections can be made for the decay products of particles that 
decayed outside of the primary vertex, such as K$^0$ or $\Lambda$\@. 



Figure~\ref{TOF_mrpc} shows two side views of the TOF tray. A MRPC basically consists of a stack of resistive plates with uniform gas gaps in between. A high voltage is applied to the graphite electrodes that have electrically floating glass plates in between Typical resistivity of the glass plates is in the order of $10^13\,\Omega/$cm. A charged particle going through the tray generates electrical avalanches in the gas gaps. The signal is read out via copper pads on the outside of the graphite electrodes, separated by $0.35\,$mm of mylar. Because of the high resistivity of the glass plates, they are transparent to the charge induction in the gaps. The signal is the sum of all avalanches in the gas gaps in between the opposing copper pads. The gas consists of 95$\,\%$ Freon R134a and 5$\,\%$ iso-butane. This gas mixture was chosen for its dielectric strength and electronegativity. The trays are mechanically supported poly-carbonate (PC\nomenclature{PC}{Poly-Carbonate}) boards on each side, glued to honeycomb structures that are rigid while having a low material budget.

\end{figure}

The PID capabilities of TOF are demonstrated in Figure~\ref{TOF_pid}\@. The fraction of the speed of light in vacuum $\beta$\nomenclature{$\beta$}{Fraction of the speed of light in vacuum} is calculated as
\begin{equation}
 \beta = \frac{L}{ct}
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the path-length from the primary vertex (PV\nomenclature{PV}{Primary Vertex}) and $t$ is the flight time, measured by TOF\@.
A clear separation of the particle species is visible, moreover it reaches further in \pt, compared to \dedx\ PID of the TPC e.g.\ shown in Figure~\ref{TpcPid}\@.

\end{figure}

% \subsection{Endcap-Time-of-Flight Detector (eTOF)}
In 2019, the time-of-flight coverage of STAR was greatly expanded by a new upgrade to the STAR detector: the endcap-Time-Of-Flight detector (eTOF\nomenclature{eTOF}{endcap-Time-Of-Flight detector}~\cite{eTOF})\@. This detector was developed in collaboration with the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM\nomenclature{CBM}{Compressed Baryonic Matter}~\cite{CBM}) as eTOF doubles as a test of the CBM Time-Of-Flight detector. eTOF consists of trays of similar design to the TOF mounted to the endcap of the TPC\@. The layout is shown in Figure\ref{eTOF}\@. eTOF enhances the pseudorapidity reach of PID via time-of-flight measurements down to at least $\eta > 1.5$~\cite{eTOF_LOI}\@.

The VPD~\cite{VPD} consists of two identical assemblies, positioned \SI{5.7}{\metre} from the center of STAR\@. A schematic 
picture of an assembly can be seen in Figure~\ref{VPDassembly}. Each of them is made of 19 detectors, consisting of a lead 
converter, followed by a fast plastic scintillator read by a photo-multiplier tube. The main purpose of the VPD is to measure 
photons from $\uppi^0$ decays in forward direction and thus accurately measure the time of the collision, as well as 
the position of the primary vertex with the resolution of $\sim \SI{1}{\centi\metre}$ and  $\sim \SI{2.5}{\centi\metre}$ 
for Au+Au and p+p collisions, respectively.
